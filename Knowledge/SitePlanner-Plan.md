# Site Planner — Build Plan

## What We're Building (Simple Terms)

A digital site-planning tool — think Google Maps meets a drawing canvas. The user loads a floor plan or satellite map, places cameras, cores, and add-on devices onto it, and the tool automatically draws colored cones showing exactly what each camera can see (and what it misses). As devices are added, a live shopping list (BOM) builds itself on the side with prices, licensing, and storage estimates. The final output is a professional PDF report the user can send to a client.

It is equivalent to tools like IPVM's Camera Calculator or Genetec Site Designer, but built into Lumana.

> **Device types supported:** Video cameras, Lumana Cores (recording appliances), and Add-on devices (per-camera: Cloud Storage, External NAS, Timelapse, Cloud Metadata, Cloud Snapshot; per-plan: Alerts Storage, Event Tags Storage, Video Verification). Access control devices (door controllers, readers) and sensors (air quality, intercoms) are planned for a future phase.

## 0. Application Pages & Navigation Flow

The Site Planner is a multi-page application. Each page is a standalone HTML prototype.

```
site-planner-sites.html          (Projects list — entry point)
    ↓  click project
site-planner-location.html       (Location detail — map + BOM summary)
    ├→  click plan / "View plan"
    │   site-planner-prototype.html  (Full interactive editor)
    └→  read-only link
        site-planner-plan.html       (Plan viewer — BOM only, no canvas)
```

### site-planner-sites.html — Projects List (442 lines)

Landing page showing all projects in a filterable table.

| Element | Details |

## I. Recommended Tech Stack

### For the Interactive Prototype (this repo's style — standalone HTML)
| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Canvas / drawing | **Konva.js** (CDN) | Best 2D canvas lib for draggable, interactive objects. Handles FoV cones, walls, snap-to-grid natively. |
| Maps | **Leaflet.js** (CDN) + OpenStreetMap | Free, no API key needed for prototype. Swap to Google Maps API in production. |
| 3D preview | **Three.js** (CDN) | Industry standard WebGL. Lightweight enough for an in-browser preview pane. |
| PDF export | **jsPDF + html2canvas** (CDN) | Capture canvas + BOM table into a shareable PDF. |
| URL sharing | **LZString** (CDN) | Compresses plan JSON into URL hash for serverless sharing. |
| State | Vanilla JS (plain objects + event listeners) | Sufficient for prototype scope. |

### For Production (engineering handoff recommendation)
| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | **React 18** + TypeScript |
| Canvas | **Konva.js** via `react-konva` |
| Maps | **Google Maps JS API** + `@react-google-maps/api` |
| 3D | **Three.js** via `@react-three/fiber` + `@react-three/drei` |
| State | **Zustand** (lightweight, single store) |
| PDF | **@react-pdf/renderer** or Puppeteer (server-side) |
| File parsing | **pdf.js** (floor plan PDF upload), **dxf-parser** (CAD/DWG) |
| Backend sync | REST API calls to existing Lumana backend |

## III. Design Considerations

### Visual Language
- **Match existing Lumana UI**: dark sidebar, white canvas area, purple accent (`#7c3aed`).
- **Canvas background**: dark satellite-style (`#1c2333`) with dot grid pattern.
- **Camera icons**: small colored circle markers on canvas with camera-type symbol.
- **Core icons**: rounded rectangle with circuit-board SVG, colored by user choice.
- **Add-on icons**: rounded rectangle with storage icon (horizontal lines), colored by type.
- **FoV cones**: single gradient cone using the camera's brand color — **no multi-color DORI zones**. One cone with three opacity layers of the same hue: Detection (outer) ~15%, Recognition (middle) ~30%, Identification (inner) ~50%.
- **Walls/obstructions**: thick lines; red solid / blue dashed (glass) / amber dotted (fence).

### Layout (2-panel — toolbar + canvas + right panel)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Top bar: breadcrumb (Project > Location > Plan)    │
│  Action bar: Share, Export PDF, Export CSV, Save     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Toolbar: +Device, +Camera | Select, Move, Wall |   │
│           Basemap | Zoom | Clear All                │
├──────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────┤
│                                  │                  │
│     Map Canvas (center)          │  Properties      │
│     [Konva stage over Leaflet]   │  Panel (700px)   │
│                                  │  + BOM tab       │
│                                  │                  │
└──────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

> **Note:** The original left catalog panel was removed. Device creation is now handled entirely from the toolbar via `+ Device` dropdown (Core / Add-On) and `+ Camera` button.

### Device Placement UX

**Cameras:**
- `+ Camera` toolbar button opens Camera Model Picker modal (IPVM-style 3-column browser)
- Search by brand, model, form factor, resolution, IR range, NDAA compliance
- `CAMERA_DB` — 40+ models across 8 brands (Axis, Hanwha, Bosch, Hikvision, Dahua, Avigilon, Pelco, Generic)
- Placing pre-fills FoV angle, DORI ranges, focal length, color

**Cores:**
- `+ Device → Core` opens Core Type Picker modal
- 4 types: Core 10 (10ch/$1,500), 1U Core 64 (64ch/$5,000), 2U Core 128 (128ch/$9,000), 2U Core 256 (256ch/$15,000)
- Click to place on canvas, enter name, view properties

**Add-Ons:**
- `+ Device → Add-On` opens Add-On Picker modal
- Scope toggle: **Per camera** (5 types) | **Per plan** (3 types)
- Per-camera types: Cloud Storage ($500), External NAS Storage ($800), Timelapse ($200), Cloud Camera Metadata ($150), Cloud Camera Snapshot ($100) — assigned to specific cameras, some with retention options
- Per-plan types: Alerts Storage ($300), Event Tags Storage ($250), Video Verification ($400) — payment (Upfront/Yearly) + duration options
- Camera selection modal with search when placing per-camera add-ons
- Also accessible from camera properties panel → "Add add-on" button (skips scope toggle, forces per-camera)

### Interaction Principles
1. **Click to select** a device → right panel shows its configuration.
2. **`+ Camera` button** → opens picker modal → select model → "Place Camera" → click canvas to place.
3. **`+ Device` dropdown** → Core or Add-On → opens respective picker → click canvas to place.
4. **Rotate handle** on selected camera → cone rotates.
5. **Wall tool** → click-click to draw an obstruction line that clips cones.
6. **Scale tool** → draw a line, type real-world length → sets pixels-per-meter ratio.
7. **Right-click** on device → Delete / Duplicate / Properties.
8. **Keyboard shortcuts**: `V` select, `H` move, `C` camera, `W` wall, `Del` delete, `⌘Z`/`⌘⇧Z` undo/redo, arrows nudge.

### DORI Zone Logic (FoV cone math)
For a camera at mounting height `H`, tilt angle `θ`, and focal length `f`:
- **Detection range** = sensor_width / (focal_length_mm × 0.25 px/m) *(simplified)*
- Each DORI zone is a nested arc segment within the main cone.
- Cone clips against wall segments using line-segment intersection (ray casting).
- **Glass walls**: ray continues past the wall at 55% of remaining range.
- **Fence/barriers**: ray continues at 35% of remaining range.

### Device Relationships
- **Camera → Core**: a camera can be assigned to one core; a core holds many cameras (up to its channel capacity). Tracked via `cam.coreId`.
- **Per-camera Add-On → Camera**: an add-on with `scope:'camera'` has a `cameraId` field (one-to-one from add-on side). A camera can have multiple add-ons assigned (one-to-many from camera side). Found via `state.addons.filter(a => a.cameraId === camId)`.
- **Per-plan Add-On**: `scope:'plan'` add-ons have `cameraId: null` — they belong to the project, not individual cameras. Found via `state.addons.filter(a => ADDON_TYPES[a.typeId].scope === 'plan')`.
- The camera properties panel shows "Core Assignment" and "Assigned add-ons" (per-camera) blocks.
- The BOM tab shows per-camera add-ons nested under their camera, per-plan add-ons in a separate "Plan Add-Ons" group.
